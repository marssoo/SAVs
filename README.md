# Modifications of the branch

- Added possibility to use `llava-onevision-qwen2-0.5b-ov` instead of `llava-onevision-qwen2-7b-ov`.
- Added `custom_builder.py` to allow it to run locally on 5.2 GB of vRAM.
- Added an executable `run.sh` allowing easy model swapping.

---

Running the llava models, see `run.sh` :

```sh
python3 -m src.run \
    --model_name llava_ov_0.5 \
    --data_name natural_ret \
    --train_path data/naturalbench_ret_train.jsonl \
    --val_path data/naturalbench_ret_test.jsonl
```

Switching `llava_ov_0.5` for `llava_ov_7b` will ignore all modifications and use the base code to run `llava-onevision-qwen2-7b-ov` as intended by the author.
